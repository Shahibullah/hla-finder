    <h2>Why HLA Typing Is So Important?</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>HLA typing</strong> is important because it explains how a person’s immune system
        recognizes what belongs to the body (“self”) and what does not (“foreign”).
        This makes HLA typing central to safe transplantation, accurate disease diagnosis,
        and modern immune-based therapies.
    </p>

    <p>
        When HLA types are known, clinicians can better predict and prevent immune-mediated
        complications such as graft rejection, autoimmune diseases, and severe drug reactions.
    </p>

    <h3>🧬 Transplantation Medicine</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            HLA typing is essential to match organ or stem cell donors and recipients so the
            recipient’s immune system does not attack the graft.
        </li>
        <li>
            Better HLA matching improves graft survival and overall patient outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Closer matching reduces risks such as acute rejection and
            graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), especially in stem cell transplantation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🩺 Disease Diagnosis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Certain HLA alleles are strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
        </li>

        <li>
            HLA typing also helps explain differences in infection susceptibility
            and vaccine responses among individuals.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="dashboard-divider">

    <h3>💊 Adverse Drug Reactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Some severe drug reactions are strongly linked to specific HLA alleles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Examples include:
            <ul>
                <li>Stevens–Johnson syndrome with carbamazepine</li>
                <li>Allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Screening patients by HLA type before prescribing these drugs
            can prevent life-threatening adverse reactions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧪 Cancer and Cell Immunotherapy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            T-cell–based therapies (CAR-T, TCR-engineered cells, adoptive T-cell therapy)
            rely on HLA molecules to present tumor antigens.
        </li>
        <li>
            HLA typing is critical for selecting suitable patients
            and designing effective and targeted cancer therapies.
        </li>
        <li>
            Detailed HLA profiling also reduces the risk of off-target immune toxicity.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🌍 Broader Clinical and Research Value</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Supports population-level studies of immune diversity.
        </li>
        <li>
            Helps identify disease-associated biomarkers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Informs vaccine design, cancer-vaccine research, and precision medicine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Today, HLA typing is a standard tool wherever immune compatibility
            or immune-mediated risk must be evaluated.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="dashboard-note">
        In summary, HLA typing plays a critical role in modern medicine by improving
        transplant safety, guiding diagnosis, preventing adverse drug reactions,
        and enabling advanced immunotherapies.
